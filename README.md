# Rails Project Mode

Woo! We're almost done with Rails. You're at the point where you know enough rails to start building your own side project. This is an awesome time for you as a developer because you are liberated from the tests in the labs. Use this opportunity to build something great or just simply review and build something you know. (Doctors, Patients and Appointments is always still cool)

This means that you'll spend some time this weekend working on a project to cement your knowledge of Rails

Some example project ideas from previous classes:

1. [Regifter](http://regifter.herokuapp.com/) - A gift trading app that lets users upload images and descriptions of unwanted gifts and propose trades with other users.
2. [Flatiron Postcard](http://www.flatironpostcard.com/) - An app that lets you create and send custom postcards to friends and family
3. Petster - A social media site for pets


**Note: The projects above were completed over a week by a team**



## Requirements:

1. You should have least 3 models. You do not have to only do a many-many relationship. You may decide to have a has-many relationship. Decide on the right solutiin for your project

2. Some methods in your models. As we saw in the project your models can have methods to accompany the build in Activerecord methods

3. Try to practice some more complex forms. The basic new and edit forms are awesome and easy but try to take it one step further.

5. Don't worry about getting too deep . That being said avoid APIs and JavaScript until your mod 2 project

## Weekend Guideline

1. Come up with a plan for your models and associations
2. Sketch some rough wireframes. 
3. Utilize restful routing for your routes
3. Do the thing and make your app
